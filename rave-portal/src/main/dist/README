Apache Rave Demo - README

ABOUT

Apache Rave is a new web and social mashup engine. Its goal is to provide an out-of-the-box as well as an extendible lightweight Java platform to host, serve and aggregate (Open)Social Gadgets and services through a highly customizable and Web 2.0 friendly front-end. For more information, see http://rave.apache.org/

The binary release includes Tomcat 6 and two WAR files: Apache Rave and Apache Shindig.  This is a self-contained release: you should be able to run Rave with no additional downloads.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

The binary distribution (.tar.gz or .zip) must be unpacked with the appropriate tool. The minimum requirement for running the binary release is Java SDK 6+.  Rave should work on standard operating systems (Linux and Unix flavors including Mac OS X; Windows Vista and 7).  

RUNNING TOMCAT

From the unpacked RAVE distribution directory, execute the startup script from Rave's bin subdirectory, either startup.sh (linux/unix/osx) or startup.bat (windows). To shut down tomcat, run either shutdown.sh or shutdown.bat, also located in Rave's bin subdirectory. Tomcat logging and error messages are in logs/catalina.out. Unix users can follow output with tail -f logs/catalina.out.

Tomcat by defualt uses the port 8080, if the port is used, an alternative port can be specified in the conf/server.xml. Further details on this configuration can be refered from http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/server.html.

BROWSER ACCESS

After starting tomcat, point your browser to http://localhost:8080/portal.  There are currently no known browser restrictions.

LOGIN ACCOUNTS

Rave comes with the following built-in accounts (username and password are the same): canonical, john.doe, jane.doe, george.doe, mario.rossi, and maija.m.  Rave also supports OpenID login to one account: http://rave2011.myopenid.com.  The OpenID password is "rave2011".  

KNOWN ISSUES

This is a very early release of Rave that the developers hope will prompt greater participation from the Apache community.  Currently there is no way to administer accounts or add arbitrary gadgets or widgets through the Web interface.  For a comprehensive set of developement issues, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/rave.  Rave has also not been extensively tested on a range of operating systems and browsers.
