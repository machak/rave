Note that the Shindig code that reads this file only reads the first line, so the actual encryption key at runtime when
using this key file ends up being just the first line in this file (normally this file would just contain a single line
with the encryption key).  See the source of the Shindig Java class org.apache.shindig.common.crypto.BasicBlobCrypter
for more info on how this key is used and how to generate a secure key.
